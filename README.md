# How to Start

1. You need to acquire an access token and a secret
2. Install a client using composer: `composer require "covery/client=^1.0.0"`

<a name="basic" />
# Basic Integration

The first thing you need is to initialize `Facade` with credentials and transport. 
To do this, place the following code somewhere close to your application initialization:

```php
use Covery\Client\Facade;
use Covery\Client\Transport\Curl;

Facade::setTransport(new Curl(5.0 /* Timeout */));
Facade::setCredentials('<token>', '<secret>');
```

That's all!

Having completed this procedure, you can now query Covery using `Facade::sendEvent` or `Facade::makeDecision`.
You can test connectivity problems and token/secret validity using `Facade::ping` request.

Login event example:

```php
use Covery\Client\Envelopes\Builder;
use Covery\Client\Facade;
use Covery\Client\Identities\Stub;

$event = Builder::loginEvent(md5($userId), string($userId), time(), 'foo@bar.com', false) // Using builder
    ->addIdentity(new Stub())                                                             // stub identity
    ->build();                                                                            // building envelope

$result = Facade::makeDecision($event);
if ($result->isReject()) {
    // ...
}
```

# Tech Details

<a name="facade" />
## Facade

`Covery\Client\Facade` is a static wrapper over `Covery\Client\PublicAPIClient`. If you use dependency injection
or other application assembly mechanism, you may prefer not to use `Facade`, and rather use the client directly.

<a name="psr" />
## PSR-3, PSR-4 and PSR7

1. Covery client supports PSR-3 loggers. You may assign them to `Facade` calling `Facade::setLogger` or to `PublicAPIClient` passing a logger as a constructor argument.
2. Covery client code uses PSR-4 autoloader. Just require `/vendor/autoload.php`.
3. HTTP communication uses PSR-7 HTTP message, so you may extend the client's capabilities as you see fit.

<a name="transports" />
## Transports

Covery client may use any class that satisfies `Covery\Client\TransportInterface` to send requests. Covery client ships with two major implementations:

1. `Covery\Client\Transport\Curl` - simple PHP curl implementation
2. `Covery\Client\Transport\OverGuzzle` - adapter over [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) HTTP client

<a name="ping" />
## Health Check

To perform network accessibility and token validity tests, run `ping()` method inside `Facade`
or `PublicAPIClient`. It will throw an exception on any problems or return your token access level on success. 
In most cases it will return `"DECISION"` as your token level.

<a name="envelopes" />
## Envelopes

Methods `sendEvent` and `makeDecision` require envelope as argument. Envelope is a pack of following data:

* `SequenceID` - Event grouping identifier. Covery will attempt to group events using this field. It is recommended to use 
   userID as a sequence ID. However, Covery requires a long string (6-40 characters) in this field, so you may use `md5($userId)` as `SequenceID` for better results.
* `Identities` - List of identities this event belongs to. For most cases a single `Identities\Stub` is enough.
* `Type` - Event type, one of:
  * `registration` - registration event
  * `confirmation` - registration confirmation event, must have the same `SequenceID` with registration event
  * `login` - login event, must have the same `SequenceID` with registration event
  * `transaction` - payment event, must have the same `SequenceID` with registration and login events
  
Envelope specifications are bundled in `Covery\Client\EnvelopeInterface`.

You may provide the following as envelopes:

1. Own implementations of `EnvelopeInterface`. For example, your own payment order model may be extended to implement `EnvelopeInterface`, then you may pass it to `sendEvent` and/or `makeDecision` directly.
2. Custom-built `Covery\Client\Envelopes\Envelope`
3. Envelopes built using `Covery\Client\Envelopes\Builder` (don't forget to invoke `build()`!)

<a name="results" />
## Results

1. `ping` will return `string` containing current token access level on success.
2. `sendEvent` will return `integer` (may be x64) containing ID of a stored entity on Covery side. You should log it.
3. `makeDecision` will return `Covery\Client\Result` object:
   * Call `getScore()` to obtain score in range [-100, 100]
   * Method `isAccept()` will return `true` if Covery did not found fraud in incoming envelope data
   * Method `isReject()` will return `true` if Covery found fraud in incoming envelope data

<a name="exceptions" />
## Exception Tree

* `Covery\Client\Exception` - base exception
  * `Covery\Client\EnvelopeValidationException` - thrown if envelope failed client side validation
  * `Covery\Client\DeliveredException` - exception delivered for Covery server
    * `Covery\Client\AuthException` - authorization exception
  * `Covery\Client\IoException` - server communication error
    * `Covery\Client\TimeoutException` - timeout
